# Space-Invaders-using-Pygame
Space Invaders is considered one of the most influential video games of all time.
Space Invaders is a fixed shooter in which the player moves a laser cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead.
It helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry, and ushered in the golden age of arcade video games. 
The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser to earn as many points as possible.
